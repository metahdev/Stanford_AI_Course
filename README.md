# Stanford_AI_Course
If you are taking this course, try your best to solve all of the homework/tasks on your own. This repository is mainly for my peers and me to easily access all of the course's source code. 
Also, note that only "k means clustering" homework is done right. We had only 2 weeks to cover all these topics so I probably did a lot of mistakes there. NN homework isn't even nearly completed, lol. 
Might sit down and do all these tasks somewhere in the future, when I will get more interested in AI.
